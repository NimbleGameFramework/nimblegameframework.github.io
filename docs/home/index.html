    Web-RPG-Framework

  <p>This project is currently in development. Checkout the latest prototype <a href="/examples/index.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>This framework helps you build web based rpg games. It tries to provide the tools that you will need to design and create a 2d map, a group of entities, and a main character who the player can control. It's meant to be a open, free alternative to tools like RPG Maker. It does not seek to be as complete or as in depth as other tools, however it does try to open the door for further development.</p>
